        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My husband really loved this. There is a lot of liquid, and when I saw how much of the sauce there was I knew there was no way this was fitting in an 8 in. baking dish. I made it in a deep 9x13 pan and it barely fit. I did modify a bit: used ricotta cheese instead of cottage so it was less watery; added 1 chopped jalapeño to the sauce for a little more flavor and a bit of spice; did not have tomatoes with cilantro and lime so juiced 1/2 lime and chopped some cilantro into the sauce; and definitely need more than 5 tortillas, especially since it needs to go into a bigger dish. It has very good flavor, but the tortillas actually kind of disintegrate so you don't really have layers at the end.</p>
